# DJAZE
DJAZE is a iOS application that provides live feedback for DJs from bargoers.

DJAZE uses SpotifyKit, a Swift client for the Spotify Web API, and Firebase Firestore.

As this is a development version, we have a back button for ease of testing - this causes data to be overwritten if going back and forth between the two.  In full version there is no back button.
